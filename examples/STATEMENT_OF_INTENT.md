For my Industrial Technology Multimedia Major Project, I aim to design, develop, and produce [State the specific multimedia product type, e.g., an interactive educational website, a 2D animated short film, a virtual reality guided tour, a multi-platform mobile application] titled '[Your Project Title]'. 

This project is driven by the need to address [Clearly and concisely state the specific problem, opportunity, or need that your project responds to. Be specific to your chosen topic and target audience. E.g., the lack of engaging online resources for understanding complex physics concepts; the opportunity to use immersive media to document local history; the need for a user-friendly tool to assist a specific community group.]

My project will specifically focus on [Briefly outline the core content, subject matter, or user experience that the project will provide. E.g., illustrating the principles of quantum mechanics; documenting the history of the old town square; providing a platform for scheduling volunteer activities.] by primarily utilising [List the main multimedia forms/technologies you will employ, e.g., web design and development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), 2D character animation and motion graphics, 3D modelling and rendering, interactive scripting and user interface design.].

The development process and rationale behind '[Your Project Title]' will be comprehensively documented within the accompanying management folio. This folio will detail the journey from initial concept through research, design development, production methodologies, and rigorous evaluation, demonstrating how the project evolves to effectively meet the intent outlined in this document.

## 1.2 Rationale: Why This Project? Why This Approach?

The decision to undertake '[Your Project Title]' is motivated by [Explain your personal interest, connection to the topic, or observation of the need/opportunity. Connect this to your interest in multimedia. E.g., my fascination with physics and a desire to make it accessible; witnessing the decline of knowledge about local history; recognizing a practical need within a community group I belong to.].

Furthermore, I believe that a [Reiterate your chosen multimedia product type, e.g., website, animated film, application] is the most effective medium to address the identified need for [Reiterate the need from the introduction] because [Justify why this specific medium is best suited for your content, target audience, and objectives.
