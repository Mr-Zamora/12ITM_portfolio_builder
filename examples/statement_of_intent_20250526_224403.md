# Statement of Intent: Monkey Magic Video Game

## 1.1 Introduction: Defining the Project and its Purpose
For my Industrial Technology Multimedia Major Project, I aim to design, develop, and produce a `Video Game` titled 'Monkey Magic Video Game'.

This project is driven by the need to address the identified gap in the market for `monkey with magic` video games.

My project will specifically focus on `retro gaming, 2D and 3D graphics, VFX, animation and coding` by primarily utilising `Flask`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Jinja`, `JavaScript`, hosted on a `Raspberry Pi server` with `joystick controls` and `keypad controls`.

## 1.2 Rationale: Why This Project? Why This Approach?
The decision to undertake this project is motivated by a personal interest in `retro gaming`, `2D and 3D graphics`, `VFX`, `animation`, and `coding`, aligning with aspirations within the `animation, multimedia, VFX, and game development` industry sectors.

Furthermore, I believe that a `video game` is the most effective medium because it is `suitable for my target market of young adults and Gen X people`.

This project provides a significant opportunity to explore and develop high-level skills in `coding` and `2D and 3D animation`, aligning with industry practices in `multimedia` and `game development`.

## 1.3 Target Audience: Who is this Project For, and Why?
The primary target audience for this project is `young adults and Gen X people`.

This audience was selected because `they have money to spend, they like nostalgia and have more time than other age groups to explore deep multilevel gameplay`.

I anticipate that this audience will have a `desire to feel young and relevant`, `feel in touch with the youth`, and `relive old memories of their youth`, which will directly influence the design and functionality of the project to evoke `coolness factor`, `aura`, `nostalgic`, `fun`, and `nerdiness` elements.

## 1.4 Project Goals and Objectives
The overarching goal of this project is to `make the target audience feel young and relevant, feel in touch with the youth, and relive old memories of their youth`. To achieve this, the project has the following specific objectives:

### Objective 1: Successfully develop and launch a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) on the Steam platform.
### Objective 2: Achieve significant online engagement and visibility through YouTube views, reviews, and comments.
### Objective 3: Obtain valuable feedback from industry professionals to refine the project.

## 1.5 Technical Implementation
The project will be developed using the following technologies and methodologies:
- `Flask`: Utilised as the web framework for the backend game logic and server-side operations.
- `HTML`, `CSS`, `Jinja`, `JavaScript`: Employed for front-end development, user interface design, and interactive gameplay elements.
- `Raspberry Pi server`: Chosen as the hosting platform for deployment, allowing for robust server-side processing and potential local multiplayer capabilities.
- `Joystick controls` and `keypad controls`: Integrated to provide intuitive and nostalgic gameplay input methods.

## 1.6 Timeline and Milestones
The deadline for my project is around Week 3, Term 3, however, it has been advised that I complete my project by Week 2 to allocate enough study time for trials. This will give me roughly forty-two weeks to complete my entire project.

The project will follow this timeline:
- **Term 4 (Weeks 1-10)**: `Initial research, concept development, and planning phase`, including concept sketches, preliminary design documentation, and initial technology setup.
- **Summer Break**: `Continued skill development and preliminary prototyping`, focusing on refining coding skills, `2D and 3D animation` techniques, and building core gameplay mechanics.
- **Term 1 (Weeks 1-10)**: `Core development phase - implementation of primary features and technologies`, including the development of core game loops, integration of `Flask` with `HTML`/`CSS`/`JavaScript`, and server deployment on `Raspberry Pi`.
- **Term 2 (Weeks 1-10)**: `Asset creation, integration, and initial testing`, encompassing `sound design`, `graphics` creation, detailed `animation` sequences, and comprehensive playtesting for functionality and bug fixing.
- **Term 3 (Weeks 1-2)**: `Final refinement, comprehensive testing, and project completion`, leading to the preparation for launch on the `Steam platform` and creation of promotional materials like `YouTube` trailers.

## 1.7 Expected Outcomes and Success Criteria
The final product must be:
1.  `Exhibit a distinct nostalgic retro video arcade aesthetic and sound design`.
2.  `Demonstrate a high level of technical proficiency in coding, animation, and graphics, coupled with engaging wit and humour`.
3.  `Receive positive external validation through Steam reviews, YouTube views and comments, and feedback from industry professionals`.
