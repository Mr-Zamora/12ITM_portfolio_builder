## 1.5 Project Parameters, Scope, and Constraints
The final output of this project will be a video game, delivered as a `Flask`-based web application accessible via a local `Raspberry Pi` server, optimized for desktop browsers, providing a standalone interactive experience.

The project's scope will encompass three distinct gameplay levels, each with unique environmental art and enemy types; custom character models and animations for the protagonist and key adversaries; an intuitive user interface (UI) and heads-up display (HUD); and a robust scoring and progression system. To maintain feasibility within the project timeline, elements such as online multiplayer functionality; extensive voice acting for all characters; dynamic user accounts or persistent data storage beyond local scores; or a fully procedurally generated level design will be excluded from the final product.

Key constraints and challenges anticipated during development include:
-   **Time:** The most significant constraint is the finite timeline of the HSC course, approximately forty-two weeks, necessitating rigorous time management and adherence to the detailed schedule outlined below.
-   **Skills & Knowledge:** Successful execution requires developing proficiency in advanced `Python` scripting for game logic and complex 2D/3D animation workflows in `Blender` and `Adobe Animate`.
