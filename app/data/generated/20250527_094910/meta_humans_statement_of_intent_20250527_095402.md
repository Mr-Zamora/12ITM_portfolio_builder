# Statement of Intent: Meta-Humans: Our Digital Existence

## 1.1 Introduction: Defining the Project and its Purpose
'Meta-Humans: Our Digital Existence' is an interactive online multiplayer game and accompanying video content that I'm developing as my Industrial Technology Multimedia Major Project. It represents my passion for exploring identity and connection in the digital age.

What really pushed me to create this was seeing the stigma around online life. There's this idea that spending too much time online is bad, but for my friends and me, being 'meta-human' means we truly live, love, thrive, and even 'die' (in a virtual sense, through experiences and connections) online. This project aims to challenge that negative perception and show the value of our digital selves.

The core of 'Meta-Humans: Our Digital Existence' is all about validating and celebrating digital identities, giving 'meta-humans' a platform to be seen and heard, and helping remove the stigma of living and interacting primarily online. For the technical implementation, I've selected tools like web design, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, JSON, and Flask for the core web and backend, alongside 2D and 3D animation, VFX, motion graphics, and sound design to create a rich, immersive world. These tools give me the flexibility and power I need for what I'm trying to achieve.

## 1.2 Rationale: Why This Project? Why This Approach?
I decided to make this project because I'm really into the concept of digital identity and how we interact in online spaces. My own experience as a 'meta-human' has shown me the power and community that exists online, and I believe this project fits right in with what I want to do in the digital game development industry. It’s a chance to build something meaningful that reflects my passion.

The decision to create an interactive online multiplayer game wasn't random. I chose this format specifically because it allows for direct engagement and shared experiences, which is crucial for exploring themes of identity and community. No other format would allow the same level of player interaction and emergent storytelling, letting users truly live out the 'meta-human' experience. Games naturally foster connection and can subtly shift perceptions, making it the perfect medium to address the stigma I've identified.

On the technical side, I'm looking forward to developing my skills in complex backend web integration using Flask and SQL for dynamic multiplayer data, advanced 3D character animation and rigging for expressive avatars, and sophisticated real-time VFX and motion graphics to create an engaging visual environment. These aren't just random techniques – they're highly valued in the interactive media and game development industry, which is where I hope to work someday.

## 1.3 Target Audience: Who is this Project For, and Why?
The main people I'm making 'Meta-Humans: Our Digital Existence' for are digitally native teenagers and young adults, roughly aged 15-25, who actively participate in online communities and gaming culture. They are the emerging 'meta-human' generation.

My research into this audience revealed that while they embrace digital life, they often face misunderstanding or criticism from older generations regarding the value and authenticity of their online interactions. This insight was eye-opening and helped me shape the entire direction of my project, focusing on validation and positive representation.

What makes this audience unique? For one thing, they have a high level of digital literacy, expect seamless online experiences, and often prefer interactive content that allows for self-expression and social connection. They also tend to appreciate games with strong thematic depth or innovative social mechanics. I'm constantly referring back to these characteristics as I develop my project to ensure it meets their specific needs for self-representation, community building, and meaningful digital interaction.

## 1.4 Project Goals and Objectives
The main goal of this project is to provide a compelling, interactive space where digital identities are celebrated, and the positive aspects of online existence are authentically explored. To do this, here are my clear and important goals:

-   **Objective 1 (User Experience/Learning Outcome):** Enable players to authentically create and express their digital identity within the game world, fostering a sense of belonging and agency regarding their online persona. This means robust avatar customisation and meaningful social interaction systems.

-   **Objective 2 (Engagement/Aesthetics/Technical Aspect):** Make the game look good with a visually consistent and engaging 'digital-meets-human' aesthetic, supported by atmospheric sound design and seamless motion graphics, ensuring a high level of immersion and visual appeal for the target audience.

-   **Objective 3 (Skill Demonstration/Problem-Solving):** Successfully build and integrate a secure, scalable multiplayer backend using Flask, SQL, and JSON, demonstrating advanced web development and database management skills critical for real-time interactive experiences.

## 1.5 Project Parameters, Scope, and Constraints
The final thing I'm making will be an interactive online multiplayer game, delivered as a web-based HTML5 application that can be accessed via modern desktop browsers, supported by a server backend. The video component will primarily be an in-game cinematic sequence and a promotional trailer.

The game will have key features including: a character creation system allowing for extensive digital avatar customisation; a primary social hub area for player interaction and community building; a simple, engaging mini-game or activity that encourages collaborative play; and an integrated in-game video sequence that reinforces the 'meta-human' narrative. To make sure I can finish the project on time, I won't be adding things like complex combat mechanics, a vast open world, or a deep crafting system to the final game. The focus is on identity and interaction.

Here are the main limitations and challenges I expect to face while making this:
-   **Time:** The biggest challenge is the time I have for the HSC course, which is about forty-two weeks. This means I really need to manage my time strictly and stick to the detailed plan I've set up, especially with the complexity of a multiplayer system.
-   **Skills & Knowledge:** To do this well, I need to get good at advanced backend development (Flask, SQL optimisation) for real-time multiplayer synchronisation and tricky 3D animation pipelines, specifically character rigging for customisation. I'll learn these skills from online tutorials (like Udemy, Stack Overflow forums), advice from people in the industry I connect with online, and a lot of practice making smaller test projects for each component.
-   **Resources & Equipment:** I need access to specific software like `Adobe Creative Suite` (for 2D/VFX/motion graphics/sound design), `Blender` (for 3D modelling and animation), and robust development environments for web technologies (`HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `SQL`, `JSON`, `Flask`). I'll be using my powerful home computer for development and will need to carefully handle things like server hosting costs and ensuring my game's performance is smooth even on varied internet connections. I'll manage this by testing and fixing bugs a lot, specifically focusing on network efficiency and rendering performance.
-   **Technical Complexity:** Making tricky features, like seamless real-time data synchronisation for multiplayer interactions and ensuring robust cross-browser compatibility, will be a big technical challenge. This means I need to plan really well, test things often, and debug carefully, breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts.

## 1.6 Timeline and Milestones
The deadline for my project is around Week 3, Term 3. But I've been told it's smart to finish by Week 2 to have enough time for trials. This gives me about forty-two weeks to do everything.

Here's my plan for the project:
-   **Term 4 (Weeks 1-10):** First up is research, getting my ideas together, and detailed planning. This includes studying existing online communities, researching effective multiplayer game structures, writing down my early designs for the 'meta-human' aesthetic, and setting up my core tech stack for web development.
-   **Summer Break:** I'll keep working on my skills and start building early versions of the game. I'll focus on getting better at backend coding for user authentication and data storage, creating initial 3D character models, and making the main game lobby parts work.
-   **Term 1 (Weeks 1-10):** This is where most of the building happens. I'll put in the main interactive features, connect my backend tech (like Flask with the front-end JavaScript, and getting the multiplayer server running), and set up the main game loops and social interaction systems.
-   **Term 2 (Weeks 1-10):** I'll create and add all the detailed 3D art, custom animations, polished VFX, immersive sound design, and the narrative video sequence. Then, I'll do lots of rigorous testing to make sure everything works and find any bugs, especially focusing on network latency and performance across different browsers.
-   **Term 3 (Weeks 1-2):** Final polish, more testing, and finishing up the project. This means optimising performance, preparing all assets for deployment, getting everything ready for the final presentation, writing up all the detailed documentation for my folio, and a final quality check.

## 1.7 Expected Outcomes and Success Criteria
I'll judge if 'Meta-Humans: Our Digital Existence' is successful based on how well it meets my goals and how good the final game and my folio are. Here are my specific success checks:
1.  **Goals Met & Player Impact:** The game needs to clearly meet its main goals (from Section 1.4), especially in allowing players to express their digital identity and fostering positive online interactions. I'll check this by conducting organised player feedback sessions where users rate the customisation options and social features, and by tracking how much time players spend in the social hub, all written down in my folio.
2.  **Tech Quality & Looks/Sounds:** The finished game needs to show that I'm really good at coding efficiently for a multiplayer environment, making smooth 3D animations for character expression, and rendering consistent, high-quality digital aesthetics. I'll prove this with detailed test reports showing good network performance and few bugs, a clear plan in my folio for how the game looks and sounds consistently, and getting positive feedback from my teachers and classmates on the art direction and technical execution.
3.  **Audience Fit & Improvement:** The game needs to be right for, easy to use for, and fun for its target audience (digitally native teenagers and young adults). I'll keep checking and improving this by getting feedback from players regularly through in-game surveys, incorporating advice from teachers and people in the interactive media industry, and constantly checking it against my detailed design plans in my folio, so the game really connects with its players and validates their online experiences.

## 1.8 Opportunities
When 'Meta-Humans: Our Digital Existence' is done, it'll be a really important part of my portfolio. It'll show off my advanced skills in making interactive online games, full-stack web development for dynamic content, tricky 3D character animation, and making compelling user interfaces. This big project will be super helpful for applying to college or jobs in digital media and game development. Plus, I'll get good at managing a big creative project from start to finish, using feedback to make it better, and solving tough tech problems when things get stressful, which will be really useful later on in my career.
