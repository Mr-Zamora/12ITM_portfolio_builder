# Statement of Intent: What Gender Am I?

## 1.1 Introduction: Defining the Project and its Purpose
For my Industrial Technology Multimedia Major Project, I'm going to design, build, and make an **interactive web-based educational experience** titled 'What Gender Am I?'.

This project is mostly happening because I've noticed a real need for better ways for parents and teenagers to talk about tough subjects like gender and identity without things getting awkward. There's a big gap in good, easy-to-use tools that help with these important conversations.

My project will specifically focus on making these discussions about gender identity and related topics much easier and more natural. It aims to offer a safe, online space for both parents and teens to explore these ideas without feeling uncomfortable or judged, especially for families with strong religious backgrounds where these talks can be extra difficult. I'll do this by primarily using `Flask` for the backend, `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` for the interactive parts, along with `Jinja` for templating. I'll also be creating `graphics`, `video`, `animation` (both `3D` and `2D`), and using `JSON` for data. A big part of this project will involve careful `UI` (user interface) and `UX` (user experience) design to make it easy and pleasant to use.

## 1.2 Rationale: Why This Project? Why This Approach?
I decided to make this project because I'm really into creating solutions for real-world problems. My personal experience with an awkward 'sex talk' with my parents, combined with seeing how many other kids – especially those from strict religious backgrounds – struggle with the same thing, has really pushed me to build something genuinely helpful and understanding. This project fits right in with what I want to do in the **interactive digital media and e-learning** industry.

I also really believe that an **interactive online video** is the best way to do this project because it lets users explore sensitive topics privately, at their own pace. They can go back and re-watch parts, and actively make choices that guide their learning. This makes it much more effective and less confrontational than traditional face-to-face talks or just reading a book. It’s perfect for delivering complex information in a way that feels personal and supportive.

This project is a huge chance for me to learn and get really good at **dynamic web application development with Flask**, **complex UI/UX design for sensitive content**, and **integrating professional 2D/3D animation into interactive video streams**, which are all skills used a lot in today's **interactive digital media and e-learning** industry.

## 1.3 Target Audience: Who is this Project For, and Why?
The main people I'm making 'What Gender Am I?' for are **parents who want to discuss gender and identity with their teenage children (aged approximately 13-18), and the teenagers themselves.**

I picked this group because they often find it hard to talk about complex subjects like gender identity openly within the family. Many existing resources are too formal, academic, or aggressive, and they don't provide a gentle or understanding space for these conversations.

I expect this audience to **be comfortable using digital platforms, have access to devices with internet, want their privacy, and prefer engaging, visual content over a lot of reading**. They also need a resource that respects different family values and makes everyone feel safe to learn. This understanding will directly change how I design the game, how it feels to play, and what it does, so it works well for them.

## 1.4 Project Goals and Objectives
The main goal of this project is to **provide a really effective and understanding digital tool that helps both parents and teenagers have comfortable, respectful conversations about gender identity, leading to more understanding and open communication.** To do this, here are my clear and important goals:

-   **Objective 1 (User Experience/Learning Outcome):** Enable users (both parents and teens) to successfully complete the interactive modules, gaining a clearer understanding of diverse gender concepts and practical communication strategies.
-   **Objective 2 (Engagement/Aesthetics/Technical Aspect):** Create a visually engaging and aesthetically pleasing interactive experience using a consistent artistic style (2D/3D animation) and an intuitive user interface (UI) to maintain user engagement and reduce any confusion.
-   **Objective 3 (Skill Demonstration/Problem-Solving):** Successfully integrate a robust `Flask`-based backend with a dynamic `HTML`/`CSS`/`JavaScript` front-end to manage interactive video branching and user progress effectively.

## 1.5 Project Parameters, Scope, and Constraints
The final thing I'm making will be an **interactive web-based application**, delivered as an **HTML5 web application, accessible via modern web browsers**.

The game will have **multiple interactive video chapters**, **decision-making points leading to different narrative paths**, **integrated graphical explanations and animations**, **a confidential section for reflection or further resources**, and **a clean and responsive user interface**. To make sure I can finish the project on time, I won't be adding things like **user accounts or login features** or **external social sharing functionality** to the final game.

Here are the main limitations and challenges I expect to face while making this:
-   **Time:** The biggest challenge is the time I have for the HSC course, which is about forty-two weeks. This means I really need to manage my time strictly and stick to the detailed plan I've set up.
-   **Skills & Knowledge:** To do this well, I need to get good at **advanced Flask development including Jinja templating**, **complex JavaScript for interactive video control and state management**, and **professional-level 2D/3D animation creation and optimisation for web delivery**. I'll learn these skills from **online tutorials (like Udemy, Skillshare), advice from people in the industry, and a lot of practice making smaller test projects**.
-   **Resources & Equipment:** I need access to certain software (`Flask`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Jinja`, `JavaScript`, `JSON`, `Adobe After Effects`, `Premiere Pro`, `Illustrator`, `Photoshop`, `Blender`, `VS Code`) and hardware (**a good computer for making art, a drawing tablet**). I'll have to carefully handle things like **optimising the performance for web deployment, ensuring it runs smoothly even with varying internet speeds and device capabilities**. I'll manage this by testing and fixing bugs a lot.
-   **Technical Complexity:** Making tricky features, like **developing a seamless branching video logic using Flask and JavaScript**, **optimising large video files and complex animations for efficient web streaming**, and **ensuring cross-browser compatibility and responsive design for different screen sizes**, will be a big technical challenge. This means I need to plan really well, test things often, and fix bugs carefully.

## 1.6 Timeline and Milestones
The deadline for my project is around Week 3, Term 3. But I've been told it's smart to finish by Week 2 to have enough time for trials. This gives me about forty-two weeks to do everything.

Here's my plan for the project:
-   **Term 4 (Weeks 1-10):** First up is research, getting my ideas together, and detailed planning. This includes studying the interactive media industry, writing down my early designs, and setting up my tech.
-   **Summer Break:** I'll keep working on my skills and start building early versions of the game. I'll focus on getting better at coding, animation, and making the main game parts work.
-   **Term 1 (Weeks 1-10):** This is where most of the building happens. I'll put in the main features, connect my tech (like Flask with the front-end, and getting the server running), and set up the main game loops or content.
-   **Term 2 (Weeks 1-10):** I'll create and add all the art, sound, and animations. Then, I'll do lots of testing to make sure everything works and find any bugs.
-   **Term 3 (Weeks 1-2):** Final polish, more testing, and finishing up the project. This means getting everything ready for the final presentation, writing up all the detailed documentation for my folio, and a final quality check.

## 1.7 Expected Outcomes and Success Criteria
I'll judge if 'What Gender Am I?' is successful based on how well it meets my goals and how good the final game and my folio are. Here are my specific success checks:
1.  **Goals Met & Player Impact:** The game needs to clearly meet its main goals (from Section 1.4), especially in **reducing the perceived awkwardness during discussions about gender identity**. I'll check this by **through post-interaction surveys and qualitative feedback analysis from a small group of target users, all written down in my folio.**
2.  **Tech Quality & Looks/Sounds:** The finished game needs to show that I'm really good at **coding efficiently, making smooth animations, and rendering graphics well**, and it should have a strong **professional and empathetic visual style, using 2D/3D animation and sound design to create a welcoming atmosphere**. I'll prove this with **test reports showing good performance and few bugs, a clear plan in my folio for how the game looks and sounds consistently, and getting positive feedback from my teachers and classmates on the art and tech.**
3.  **Audience Fit & Improvement:** The game needs to be right for, easy to use for, and fun for its audience (**parents and teenagers aged 13-18**). I'll keep checking and improving this by **getting feedback from players regularly, advice from teachers and people in the game industry, and checking it against my detailed design plans in my folio, so the game really connects with its players.**

## 1.8 Opportunities
When 'What Gender Am I?' is done, it'll be a really important part of my portfolio. It'll show off my advanced skills in **interactive web application development, multimedia content creation (2D/3D animation, video production), and user experience (UX) design for sensitive educational content**. This big project will be super helpful for applying to college or jobs in **e-learning development, digital media production, or UX/UI design**. Plus, I'll get good at **managing a big creative project from start to finish, using feedback to make it better, and solving tough tech problems when things get stressful**, which will be really useful later on.
