# Statement of Intent: Monkey Man Mania

## 1.1 Introduction: Defining the Project and its Purpose
For my Industrial Technology Multimedia Major Project, I intend to design, develop, and produce a **narrative-driven interactive digital entertainment experience** titled 'Monkey Man Mania'.

This project is primarily driven by the need to address a discernible gap in the interactive entertainment market for unique, whimsical narratives that combine fantastical elements with classic arcade mechanics, specifically the underrepresentation of `magic-infused monkey characters` within the video game landscape. This presents a genuine opportunity for innovation within the retro-gaming genre, offering a fresh, imaginative approach to established gameplay conventions.

My project will specifically focus on exploring the convergence of `retro gaming aesthetics` with `contemporary 2D and 3D graphics`, enhanced by `visual effects (VFX)`, intricate `animation`, and robust `coding`. This will be achieved by primarily utilising `Flask` for backend server logic, `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` for frontend interactive elements, templated with `Jinja`. The game will be hosted on a `Raspberry Pi` server, designed to support both `joystick` and `keypad` controls, ensuring an authentic and versatile user experience.

## 1.2 Rationale: Why This Project? Why This Approach?
The decision to undertake this project is deeply motivated by a personal interest in `retro gaming`, `2D and 3D graphics`, `VFX`, `animation`, and `coding`. This pursuit aligns directly with contemporary aspirations within the `independent game development` and `interactive media production` industry sectors, providing a tangible platform to apply and refine skills pertinent to these dynamic fields.

Furthermore, I firmly believe that a `video game` is the most effective medium for this project because its inherent interactivity and immersive qualities uniquely allow for complex narrative delivery and engaging gameplay mechanics that directly address the identified market opportunity. Unlike passive media, a video game fosters direct player agency, enabling a deeper connection with the whimsical concept of `magic-wielding monkeys` and allowing for a nuanced exploration of multi-level game design. This medium excels at creating memorable experiences that leverage both visual and auditory storytelling, perfectly aligning with the project's goal of evoking nostalgia and sustained engagement.

This project provides a significant opportunity to explore and develop high-level skills in `sophisticated character animation pipelines`, `complex game logic development` (including collision detection and state management), and `integrated sound design for immersive experiences`. These skills are directly applicable and highly valued within contemporary industry practices in the `game development` and `multimedia production` sectors.

## 1.3 Target Audience: Who is this Project For, and Why?
The primary target audience for 'Monkey Man Mania' is `Generation X (Gen X) individuals`, specifically those aged approximately 40-60, and `young adults (Millennials)` aged 25-39 who possess an appreciation for classic arcade aesthetics and engaging gameplay.

This audience was meticulously selected because research indicates a strong propensity within these demographics for `nostalgic gaming experiences`, often coupled with `disposable income` and a desire for `mentally stimulating, multi-level gameplay`. Their active engagement with digital entertainment platforms, combined with a particular appreciation for titles that evoke memories of their youth while offering contemporary depth, positions them as an ideal demographic for a retro-inspired, narrative-rich game.

I anticipate that this audience will exhibit a `high level of digital literacy`, a `preference for challenging gameplay that rewards persistent engagement`, and a `desire for immersive experiences that evoke a sense of playfulness and escapism`. They are likely to appreciate `subtle wit and humour` and a `well-crafted narrative`. These characteristics will directly influence the design, user experience, and functionality of the project, ensuring optimal engagement, a sense of familiarity, and sustained replayability.
