# Statement of Intent: Monkey Magic Video Game

## 1.1 Introduction: Defining the Project and its Purpose
For my Industrial Technology Multimedia Major Project, I aim to design, develop, and produce a `Video Game` titled 'Monkey Magic Video Game'.

This project is driven by the need to address a notable absence of video games featuring magical monkeys in the current market, presenting a unique opportunity for innovation within the gaming sector.

My project will specifically focus on creating a retro-styled 2D and 3D video game with emphasis on engaging gameplay, visual effects (`VFX`), and intricate animation, by primarily utilising `Flask`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Jinja`, and `JavaScript`, hosted on a `Raspberry Pi` server, and incorporating joystick and keypad controls.

## 1.2 Rationale: Why This Project? Why This Approach?
The decision to undertake this project is motivated by a strong personal interest in retro gaming, 2D and 3D graphics, visual effects (`VFX`), animation, and coding.

Furthermore, I believe that a `Video Game` format is the most effective medium because it is highly suitable for engaging my target market of young adults and Gen X individuals. This format allows for deep, multi-level gameplay that appeals to those who appreciate nostalgia and have ample time to explore complex game narratives.

This project provides a significant opportunity to explore and develop high-level skills in 2D and 3D animation, coding, and sound design, aligning with industry practices in game development, multimedia, and animation.

## 1.3 Target Audience: Who is this Project For, and Why?
The primary target audience for this project is Gen X individuals and young adults with an affinity for retro gaming.

This audience was selected because of their disposable income, established appreciation for nostalgia, and greater availability of time for in-depth, multi-level gameplay experiences compared to other age groups.

I anticipate that this audience will have a desire to feel young and relevant, stay in touch with contemporary culture, and relive nostalgic memories of their youth. They are also expected to value the 'coolness factor' and 'nerdiness' associated with retro arcade gaming.

## 1.4 Project Goals and Objectives
The overarching goal of this project is to deliver a highly engaging and nostalgic retro gaming experience that resonates with its target audience. To achieve this, the project has the following specific objectives:

### Objective 1: Develop a functional and stable video game utilizing `Flask`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, and hosted on a `Raspberry Pi` server.
### Objective 2: Create compelling 2D and 3D animated assets and integrated sound design that evoke a distinct retro arcade aesthetic.
### Objective 3: Produce a polished Minimum Viable Product (MVP) suitable for showcasing key multimedia skills and potential deployment on platforms like `Steam`.

## 1.5 Technical Implementation
The project will be developed using the following technologies and methodologies:
- `Flask`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Jinja`, `JavaScript`: To create a robust, interactive web-based gaming experience that can be served locally and facilitate backend logic with a dynamic front-end.
- `Raspberry Pi` server: To serve as a compact, dedicated, and portable game server, demonstrating embedded system integration and custom hardware control, including joystick and keypad inputs.
- `[2D/3D Animation Software, e.g., Blender, Adobe Animate]`: For the creation of all visual assets, including character models, environments, visual effects (`VFX`), and animated sequences, ensuring high-quality graphics.
- `[Sound Design Software, e.g., Audacity, Logic Pro]`: For the development of original sound effects and an immersive soundtrack, critical for establishing the nostalgic retro arcade atmosphere.

## 1.6 Timeline and Milestones
The project will follow this timeline:
- **Week 1-2**: [Concept Development, Storyboarding, and Initial UI/UX Design]
- **Week 3-4**: [Core Gameplay Prototyping, `Raspberry Pi` server setup, and Initial Asset Creation (2D/3D graphics)]
- **Week 5-6**: [Integration of Animation, Sound Design, and `Flask`/`JavaScript` game logic development]
- **Week 7-8**: [Comprehensive Testing, Bug Fixing, Refinement, and Preparation for Final Presentation/Deployment]

## 1.7 Expected Outcomes and Success Criteria
The final product must be:
1. Successfully capture a nostalgic retro video arcade vibe, aligning with the target audience's aesthetic preferences and incorporating witty humour.
2. Demonstrate high-level technical proficiency in coding (`Python` for `Flask`), 2D/3D animation, and graphics design, showcasing advanced multimedia capabilities.
3. Achieve positive community engagement and reviews, indicated by `Steam` reviews, `YouTube` views, and comments, reflecting a successful launch and reception of the Major Project.
