# Achieving Band 6 in Industrial Technology Multimedia

## Statement of Intent Assessment

The Statement of Intent serves as the foundation of your management folio and is referenced throughout your project. Examiners evaluate it based on:

### Key Assessment Criteria

1. **Clarity and Specificity**
   - Clearly define the project's purpose, target audience, and intended outcomes
   - Avoid vagueness to help examiners understand and evaluate your goals

2. **Justification and Rationale**
   - Provide strong reasoning for undertaking the project
   - Identify a specific need, problem, or opportunity
   - Explain why a multimedia solution is appropriate
   - Include initial research or observations that informed your decision

3. **Achievability and Scope**
   - Ensure the project is realistic given your skills, resources, and timeframe
   - Balance ambition with feasibility

4. **Multimedia Alignment**
   - Demonstrate relevance to Industrial Technology Multimedia
   - Show understanding of multimedia principles and technologies

5. **Foundation for Evaluation**
   - Establish clear criteria for evaluating the final project
   - Enable examiners to assess alignment with original goals

## Crafting a Band 6 Statement of Intent

### Essential Elements

1. **Specificity**
   - Name your project clearly
   - Define the exact problem or need
   - Identify your precise target audience (e.g., "Year 7 students learning about coastal erosion")
   - Specify the multimedia medium(s) you'll use

2. **Compelling Rationale**
   - Move beyond personal interest
   - Explain the need for your project
   - Reference initial research or observations
   - Justify your chosen approach

3. **Measurable Objectives**
   - Define what users will achieve or learn
   - Include success metrics
   - Examples:
     - "The website will enable Year 7 students to identify three common types of coastal erosion"
     - "The animation will demonstrate photosynthesis in under 2 minutes"

4. **Audience Insight**
   - Demonstrate understanding of your audience's:
     - Existing knowledge
     - Needs and interests
     - Technical capabilities
   - Justify your design choices based on audience analysis

5. **Realistic Scope**
   - Balance challenge with achievability
   - Consider your skills and resources
   - Ensure completion within the HSC timeframe

6. **Clear Final Product**
   - Specify the exact form of your project
   - Examples:
     - "A responsive multi-page website"
     - "A 5-minute 2D animated short film"
     - "An interactive game built in Unity"
